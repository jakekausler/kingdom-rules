While an arena or cathedral might stand alone as a towering edifice, most lots represent a number of buildings whose focus is to support the type of improvement that lot supports. For example, a brewery could represent a collection of brewers and bottlers and the families who support them, while a luxury merchant would represent several specialized stores. Even sprawling, sizable improvements like dumps, cemeteries, or parks might include nearby dwellings or cottages for those who tend and manage the area or live along its margins."

You do so by building a structure that has the Residential trait in a chosen lot. Settlements require a number of Residential lots equal to the number of blocks that have any structures built within them, although these residential lots need not be located one per block. For example, when a village expands to a town, it initially occupies 2 blocks. It needs 2 Residential lots in total among those 2 blocks, either both in one block or one in each block. A settlement without this minimum number of Residential lots is Overcrowded and generates 1 Unrest for the kingdom during the Upkeep phase of each Kingdom turn."

When a structure is reduced to rubble, replace the lots the structure once occupied on the Urban Grid with rubble. Having rubble in a lot doesn’t itself impact a kingdom’s Unrest or other statistics negatively, but it does prevent you from building in those lots. You must Demolish that lot before you can build there again. When a single lot that contains part of a multi-lot structure is reduced to rubble, each of the lots that contained that structure are replaced with individual lots of rubble."
