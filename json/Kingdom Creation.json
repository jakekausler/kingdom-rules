A kingdom has several different mechanical systems that define and describe it, including ability scores, skills, and feats. These develop throughout the campaign, so you should track them on a kingdom sheet. The GM and other players should work together to determine how best to keep track of their kingdom. Should the GM keep track of everything? Should one player (perhaps the one in the Ruler leadership role) always be responsible for filling out the kingdom sheet, while other players are responsible for different settlements’ Urban Grids? Should the kingdom sheet pass from one player to the next each session or each time the kingdom levels up? As long as all of the kingdom’s stats are available to everyone during play, there’s no one right answer, so use the solution that works best for your group."
