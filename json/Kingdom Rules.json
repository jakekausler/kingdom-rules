Each Fisheries hex reduces your kingdom’s Consumption score by 1, provided the Fishery is in the area of influence of one of its settlements and that settlement has a Pier or Waterfront.

Bringing a Freehold into a kingdom requires a successful Pledge of Fealty leadership action.

When the PCs add a Landmark hex to a kingdom, reduce Unrest by 1d4, and until the end of your next Kingdom turn, all Culture- and Economy‑based skill checks gain a +2 circumstance bonus.

Farmland can be established in hills and plains, but fantasy settlements can be in much less hospitable terrain. Each Ranch reduces your kingdom’s Consumption score by 1, provided the Ranch is in the area of influence of one of its settlements and that settlement has a Stable, Stockyard, or Tannery.

At the GM’s option, creature lairs may function as potential Refuges when claimed, provided the creatures that dwell there are defeated or allied with. When you claim a Refuge hex, reduce one of the kingdom’s Ruins by 1, and until the end of your next Kingdom turn, all Loyalty- and Stability-based skill checks gain a +2 circumstance bonus.

A Work Site established in a Resource hex doubles its Commodity production to 2. Work Site Commodities accumulate during the Upkeep phase of a Kingdom turn. Some kingdom events can result in Work Sites being destroyed.
