Each role grants the kingdom different benefits, provided a character—be it a PC or an NPC—takes up the mantle of serving in that role. A character can only fill one leadership role at a time, but it’s important to have all eight roles filled, for when a kingdom goes without a leader, problems arise."

This downtime works just the same as time spent retraining a feat or skill; a character can take multiple downtime activities during the course of a month as time allows. A character can attend to their duties even if they take on a downtime activity with a longer time requirement (such as retraining a class feature, which requires at least a month); in this case, simply break up the time required for that longer activity over the course of consecutive months, leaving seven days during each month for leadership activities. NPCs assigned to leadership roles are presumed to meet the downtime requirement automatically unless the PCs deliberately have them step away from the job (likely to accompany them on adventures). If a character does not spend this downtime, at the start of the Upkeep phase of the next Kingdom turn, they either incur their role’s vacancy penalty (see below) or lose one of their leadership activities for that turn."
